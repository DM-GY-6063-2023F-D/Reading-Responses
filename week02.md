## Software Studies: A Lexicon ed. Matthew Fuller

Software Studies: A Lexicon is a book organized by the professor of cultural studies and media Matthew Fuller in 2008. It is an attempt at creating more academic/intellectually diverse openings into the world of software.

Similar to what Douglas Rushkoff noted in "Program or be Programmed", Fuller acknowledges that even in academic discourse software was "seen as a tool, something that you do something with" and that "software as a field is largely seen as a question of realized instrumentality".

I agree that such a perspective fails not only to recognize software as a material "thing", but also fails to situate it in history, as something made by specific people at a specific point in time. It encompasses many aspects of culture, and is molded by social, geographical, economical and political forces. As such, software as a field of study can't be left to the computer science and engineering crowds; it benefits from different "readings".

The quote that summed this up for me was: "the ability to mix the formalized with the more messy... which gives computation its powerful effects... folds back into software in its existence as culture".

Minus 10 points to Mr. Fuller for not including more diverse voices in the book; it seems like most of the contributors are men.

The chapters I'd like to read are the ones related to the concepts we already saw in class, like: ```FUNCTION```, ```MEMORY```, ```PIXEL```, and ```VARIABLE```. The chapter called ```CLASS LIBRARY``` is a kind of funny poem that plays with other meanings for words that are often used in programming, like ```class```, ```strict``` and ```self```.
